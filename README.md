## 🌑 Introduction

**EGOOGE** is a decentralized privacy protocol built on Solana. By leveraging **ZK-SNARKs** (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) and Solana's **State Compression** technology, EGOOGE brings Monero-grade privacy to the world's fastest blockchain.

Solana is a glass house; everyone is watching. **EGOOGE is the curtain.**

## ⚡ Core Features

- **Monero-Grade Privacy**: Breaks the on-chain link between sender and receiver.
- **Invisible Transfers**: Obfuscates transaction amounts and wallet addresses.
- **High Speed, Low Cost**: Privacy shouldn't cost $10. Utilizing Solana's high throughput.
- **Non-Custodial**: You retain full control of your assets at all times.

## 🛠 Technology Architecture

EGOOGE operates as a shielded pool on Solana:

1.  **Deposit**: Users deposit SOL/SPL tokens into the EGOOGE smart contract. A "Note" (UTXO) is generated off-chain.
2.  **Mix**: The assets are pooled, breaking the traceability link using Merkle Trees and ZK proofs.
3.  **Withdraw**: Users generate a Zero-Knowledge Proof to withdraw funds to a fresh wallet, leaving no trail behind.
